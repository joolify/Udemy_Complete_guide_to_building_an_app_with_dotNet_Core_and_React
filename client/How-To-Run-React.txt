To start a **React app from CMD (Command Prompt)**, it depends on how the project was created. Here are the **three most common cases**, step by step.

---

## ✅ 1. If the project was created with **Vite** (most common now)

1. Open **CMD**
2. Go to your project folder:

```cmd
cd path\to\your\react-project
```

3. Install dependencies (only needed once):

```cmd
npm install
```

4. Start the dev server:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

5. Open the browser at the URL shown (usually):

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## ✅ 2. If the project was created with **Create React App (CRA)**

1. Open **CMD**
2. Navigate to the project folder:

```cmd
cd path\to\your\react-project
```

3. Install dependencies (only once):

```cmd
npm install
```

4. Start React:

```cmd
npm start
```

5. Browser opens automatically at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## ✅ 3. If you’re unsure which one you’re using

Run this inside your project folder:

```cmd
dir
```

Look for:

* `vite.config.ts` or `vite.config.js` → **Vite**
* `react-scripts` in `package.json` → **Create React App**

You can also check by running:

```cmd
type package.json
```

## ❗ Common problems & fixes

### 🔹 `npm is not recognized`

Install **Node.js** (includes npm):

* [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
  Then restart CMD.

---

### 🔹 PowerShell script execution error

If you previously saw:

> *running scripts is disabled*

Run **PowerShell as Admin**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

### 🔹 Port already in use

React will usually ask to use another port. Just answer:

```text
Y
```

## 🧠 Pro tip (your .NET + React setup)

Since you’re building **ASP.NET + React**, the typical workflow is:

```cmd
# Backend
dotnet watch run

# Frontend
cd client-app
npm run dev
```

---

If you want, tell me:

* Are you using **Vite or CRA?**
* Are you running React **standalone or with ASP.NET Core?**

I can tailor the exact commands for your setup 💻🔥
